### Hi! I'm Erick.
I currently manage a small (but powerful) team of imaging experts at ![The Jackson Laboratory](https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/), a biomedical research nonprofit. We work on institution-wide imaging support: think more "how do we get tool X to work in our environment" or "how do we teach people the best way to apply deep learning methods to their images", less "we will develop a custom tool for your specific research project". Our team is 100% focused on supporting open-source tools.

### What does that mean in practice?
A lot of my time is dedicated to ![OMERO](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/omero/), the imaging data management platform we use. Our team is responsible for keeping it running, drive adoption and make it easier for folks to use it. A (different) lot of my time is dedicated to ![training](https://github.com/erickmartins/training) people on how to use open-source image analysis/data management tools. There is also a lot of talking to faculty and researchers about what they need, and how we can support them.

### Here are some projects I have been working on:
- ![ezomero](https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/ezomero) is a convenience-layer library to interact with OMERO servers using Python. I am currently the main developer and maintainer.
- ![omero-cli-transfer](https://github.com/ome/omero-cli-transfer) is a utility tool for transfering data between OMERO servers, presenving hierarchies, annotations and regions of interest. I am also the main developer and maintainer.

### What else do I do?
- I spend a lot of time on ![forum.image.sc](image.sc) answering people's questions and learning from other people's answers.
- I'm part of the Curriculum Advisory Committee for the ![Image Processing curriculum at The Carpentries](https://datacarpentry.org/image-processing/).
